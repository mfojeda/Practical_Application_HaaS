Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

In this exercise I analyzed the differences between customers who accepted specific coupons by performing the following process:
- First, by gaining a business understanding of how these coupons are disbursed and the market that accepts them.
- Next, understanding the data itself by grouping the coupon types and measuring their count, in this case focusing on Coupons for Bars and Restaurants Cheaper than $20.
- Prepping the data to understand:
                - Of those who were sent the two types of coupons, what is the ratio of those who accepted
                - What were the ages groups
                - Acceptance rate by Occupation groups
                - Acceptance rate of those drivers traveling with people or solo
                - Frequency of visits per month to both Bars and Restaurants
- After modeling, I created some visuals that highlighted the acceptance rate and evaluated the coupon acceptors are older than 25 and frequent each Bar and Restaurant more than 4 times a month.
